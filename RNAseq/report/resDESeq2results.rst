A mixture of csv files and RData objects. The csv files contain the results tables for all genes with a p-value <0.05. Additionally, the KEGG annotation is added for these genes in the .csv file. The RData file contains the original result object from DESeq2, which can be loaded by R's load() function. The names of the files are constructed as following: {Column}_{condition1}_{condition2}, where Column = the name of the column containing the conditions to compare in the meta-data file, and condition1 and condtion2 = a level of the values in the column, to compare the two conditions and calculate the differentials.
