The MDS plot is generated on the 500 most variable genes in the data set. The upper panel contains data without batch correction, while the lower is batch corrected. The four plots from left to right show progressing filtering of the data, by removing low count genes from the data set (which generally tend to have high variability). The data to the plot can be found in {{snakemake.output["csv"]}}.
